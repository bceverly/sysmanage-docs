Collected data is used exclusively for:
1. System monitoring and health tracking
2. Software inventory management
3. Configuration compliance verification
4. Security status monitoring
5. Administrative task execution

Data usage is entirely determined by the system administrator who deployed the agent. The SysManage project itself does not use, access, or analyze any collected data.
```

## Form Section 5: Wikipedia Article

### Wikipedia Article URL (English)
```
[IF CREATED]:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SysManage

[IF NOT CREATED]:
Not yet available. The project is building notability through active development, user adoption, and community engagement. We plan to pursue Wikipedia article creation once sufficient independent coverage exists.
```

### Why no Wikipedia article?
```
SysManage is a relatively new open source project (started [YEAR]). While we have active development and growing user adoption, we do not yet have the extensive independent media coverage required by Wikipedia's notability guidelines.

We are actively building notability through:
- Conference presentations and talks
- Technical blog posts and tutorials
- Academic and research collaborations
- Growing user base and deployments
- Open source community engagement

We plan to pursue Wikipedia article creation in [TIMEFRAME] once we have accumulated sufficient independent reliable sources as required by Wikipedia guidelines.
