# Regenerate the apt repository metadata under repo/agent/deb.
#
# Kept byte-identical with sysmanage-agent/scripts/build-apt-repo.sh — the two
# repos each need it (the agent publishes, the prune job republishes) and there
# is no shared checkout.  If you change one, change both; the self-checks at the
# bottom mean a divergence fails loudly instead of silently publishing a broken
# repo.
#
# There used to be THREE implementations of this, and they drifted: the Makefile ran a bare `apt-ftparchive release .`, which emits a
# Release file containing ONLY Date + checksums.  apt needs Suite / Codename /
# Components / Architectures to fetch indices for a non-flat repo, so whichever
# writer ran last decided whether the repo worked at all.  Symptoms when it
# went wrong (2026-08, found while validating bare-metal provisioning):
#
#   W: Conflicting distribution: ... Release (expected stable but got )
#   E: Failed to fetch .../Packages.gz  Hash Sum mismatch
#   ... and then: "Unable to locate package sysmanage-agent"
#
# The hash mismatch came from the same split brain — one writer regenerated
# Packages while the Release checksums still described the other's output.
#
# The decisive one was the prune job: it runs LAST (fired by repository_dispatch
# right after a release publishes) and mirrors back with --delete, so whatever
# it generated was what the world saw — a correct release-time Release was
# overwritten within minutes, every single release.
#
# Usage:  scripts/build-apt-repo.sh <path-to-repo/agent/deb>
