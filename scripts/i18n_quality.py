Deterministic translation-quality checks, shared by the verifier and the
translation service.

Every other i18n gate in these repos was written after one particular failure
was found, and only recognizes that failure.  These checks are the part of
``i18n_verify.py`` that needs no model: they run on EVERY translated value on
every ``make lint``, and the translation service runs the same ones on its own
output so it stops producing these defects instead of handing them to a gate.

Each check was calibrated on 2026-10-08 against 780 randomly sampled real
translations and the defects a scan found in sysmanage-docs that day:

  ENGLISH   ordinary English left in a translation, whole or word by word:
            "Cliquer "Ajouter Dépôt" to appliquer to tous compatible hôtes",
            "The 규정 준수 엔진 is accessible 을(를) 통해 the REST API:".
            Detected by English FUNCTION words (the, to, is, with...) outside
            code, quotes and placeholders.  Kept IT terms ("Rate Limiting",
            "Backup") never contain them, which is why this beats both a
            language-ID library (flagged 23 of the 780 good values) and asking
            the model (it passed whole English paragraphs).  2+ hits flagged
            4 of the 780 -- every one genuinely broken -- and 112 of 126
            known half-English values; the other 14 were correct.

  SHAPE     a value that is not a translation at all: a Python list literal
            ("['Main Config File', 'Arquivo de Configuração Principal']"), a
            non-string JSON leaf, or a "[MISSING: ...]" / "[... MANQUANT: ...]"
            marker a pipeline wrote and a later run translated.

  PLACEHOLDERS  an interpolation token added, dropped or altered.

Shared verbatim by sysmanage, sysmanage-agent, sysmanage-professional-plus and
sysmanage-docs (scripts/sync_i18n_tooling.py); only the license header differs.
